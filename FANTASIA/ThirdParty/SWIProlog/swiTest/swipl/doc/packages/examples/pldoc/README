---++ SWI-Prolog documentation server

Welcome to the SWI-Prolog documentation server.  This server provides an
integrated search facility to the   SWI-Prolog Reference Manual, Package
documentation as well as documented libraries.

---++ Using this server

Search all documentation using the search-box at the top-left corner.
For example, try:

load xml

---++ Experimental server!

This server is experimental. The UI has   not  been evaluated nor tested
extensively. We modified most of  the   library  sources  to satisfy the
PlDoc structured documentation conventions using  a simple =sed= script.
The material has been  reviewed  and   corrected  very  partially.  Many
libraries are not yet fully documented in the source.

---++ Running the server locally

You can install this server  locally   using  the  out-of-the-box 5.6.18
release of SWI-Prolog  from   http://www.swi-prolog.org.  The  directory
holding the server setup is   in  =|doc/packages/examples/pldoc|= If you
have reusable libraries, document them according to the PlDoc structured
comment specification and make sure  they   are  loaded into the server.
This makes your libraries searchable in the same interface.
