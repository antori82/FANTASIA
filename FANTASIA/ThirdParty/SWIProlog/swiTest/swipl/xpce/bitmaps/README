			PCE Standard Icon Directory


This directory contains a number of  cursors  and  icons  developed  for
various   applications.    The  icon  directory  has  been  restructured
considerably from  the  previous  release  tape,  which  contained  many
duplicates and very specific or badly designed icons.

No claims on the quality of the design are made.  It is also not ensured
later versions of this directory is upwards compatible.  Use it just  as
a starting point for your own icons.
