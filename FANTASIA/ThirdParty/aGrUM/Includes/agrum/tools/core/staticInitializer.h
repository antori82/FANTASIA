namespace gum {

  // A dummy enum that, when passed as argument to a consteval constructor, will
  // mean that we want this constructor to be used to initialize a static variable
  // at compile time.
  // Basically, the idea is the following:
  // 1/ in the .cpp file, create the "constinit const" static variables you need
  //    using a constructor to which StaticInitializer::CONSTINIT is passed in
  //    argument (see file tools/core/AVLTree.cpp)
  // 2/ in the .h file, declare "extern constinit cont" these static variables.
  //    If these correspond to iterators of templates, you may need to declare
  //    pointers to these variables as "inline constexpr void* const" and use
  //    these pointer rather than the static variables themselves (this avoids
  //    having a lot of strict-aliasing rule warnings). See the very end of
  //    file AVLTree.h for an example.
  enum class StaticInitializer : char {
    _CONSTINIT,
    _CONSTEXPR
  };
