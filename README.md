<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br/>

FANTASIA is a collection of tools for UE that we have developed over the years to work with Embodied Conversational Agents at the University of Padua and at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy. Since we have been working with different characters for different tasks, I developed these tools so that the functionalities characterizing one agent could be easily transferred to others. Since we have done this multiple times with minimal effort, now, and since there appears to be an increasing interest towards Virtual Humans in UE, we decided to take all the dirty code we have and re-engineer it so that we could distribute it to the community. We hope it will be helpful for other colleagues in the academy but we also hope it will help people, in general, produce amazing stuff.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. If not already present, create a folder named "Plugins" in your PROJECT
3. Copy the contents of the FANTASIA folder from the repository to the Plugins folder
4. Launch UE. You should see FANTASIA listed in the Plugins list

## Notes

If you get an error stating that your project cannot be launched because of FANTASIA, please check that the dll files included in the ThirdParty->Redist folder of the repository have been copied where your project's binaries are found. These should be under Binaries->Win64. If the dll files are not there, please copy them manually. FANTASIA currently uses dynamically linked libraries from Microsoft and Amazon to access services exposed to Blueprints.
